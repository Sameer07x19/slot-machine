# Slot Machine Game

This is a simple terminal-based slot machine game built using JavaScript. The game allows users to deposit money, place bets, and spin the slot machine reels to try their luck. The winnings depend on the alignment of symbols on the reels.

I created this game as a practice project following a tutorial. You can check out the tutorial video on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/E3XxeE7NF30?si=LkWtDy8H1oLFGwcP).
